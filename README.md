# linter-flint

Lint projects using [`flint`][flint].

# Installation

You need to have [`flint`][flint] installed on your system before using this
package. Once that is setup this package should work right away. If you are
getting messages about `flint` not being available you may need to set the full
path to it in your settings.

As this package is just a wrapper around `flint`, you will need something to
actually run it. By default the [Linter][] package will be installed for you to
fill this need.
